# Link Replacement Configuration
# This file maps broken internal links to external URLs or local placeholders
# When a broken link matches a key in this file, it will be replaced with the corresponding URL

# Exact path replacements (matches the exact link path)
replacements:
  # Developer tools links
  /developer-tools/faucet: https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/faucet
  /developer-tools/dashboard: https://developer.metamask.io/login
  
  # Add more exact path replacements below as needed
  # Example:
  # /some/broken/path: https://docs.metamask.io/some/broken/path

# Pattern-based replacements (uses regex patterns to match links)
# Patterns are applied before exact replacements
patterns:
  # Dashboard links - matches /developer-tools/dashboard with sub-paths
  # Extracts the path after /developer-tools/dashboard and appends to replacement URL
  # Example: /developer-tools/dashboard/how-to/secure-an-api/set-rate-limits
  #   → https://developer.metamask.io/how-to/secure-an-api/set-rate-limits
  # Note: Exact /developer-tools/dashboard is handled by exact replacements above
  - pattern: '/developer-tools/dashboard/.+'
    replacement: 'https://developer.metamask.io'
    extractPath: true
