## description: IPFS network information.



# IPFS

The [Interplanetary File System (IPFS)](../../how-to/use-ipfs/migrate-to-infuras-ipfs-service.md) is a distributed, [peer-to-peer (p2p)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) storage network used for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

:::caution Restricted access

New IPFS key creation is disabled for all users. Only IPFS keys that were active in late 2024 continue
to have access to the IPFS network.

:::

Content is accessible from peer nodes located anywhere in the world. These nodes relay information, store it, or both.

To integrate your IPFS project with Infura, create an [Infura API key](../../get-started/infura.md#2-view-your-api-key).
