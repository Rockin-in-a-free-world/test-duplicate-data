# Migrate to Infura's IPFS service

The updated Infura IPFS service offers:

- A [project dashboard](dashboard/dashboard-placeholder.md) with essential statistics.
- Pinning and unpinning API access.
- Publishing files in the background to the IPFS P2P network, so that content is globally accessible.

Use the [`ipfs-copy`](https://github.com/INFURA/ipfs-copy) command-line tool to migrate your existing data if you're:

- [An existing Infura IPFS user, using the older Infura IPFS service](https://github.com/INFURA/ipfs-copy/blob/master/MigrationExistingUsers.md).
- [Migrating from a self-hosted IPFS node](https://github.com/INFURA/ipfs-copy/blob/master/MigrationNewUsers.md).
