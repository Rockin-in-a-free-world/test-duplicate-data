title: Test worked
---

This tests supporting auto gen side bars


1. the remark plugins are failed experiments -- we might take another look at making this work
2. we want to use remark plugin that consumes the link-replacements.yaml to keep it simple for maintainers to update yaml only
3. npm start should only run docusaurus, in poc the script is run by hand first and only after the data is ported and processed is it run. npm build should run the script then run the build
4. mjs I dont know, I think they should be removed

I dont want to start with any of these item: retain these to be looked at
